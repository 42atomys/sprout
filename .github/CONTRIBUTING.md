## Types of Contributions

### Issues

#### Creating a New Issue

If you notice a problem or have an enhancement idea, check if there's an existing issue first. If not, open a new issue using a suitable [issue template](https://github.com/go-sprout/sprout/issues/new/choose).

#### Resolving an Issue

Browse our [open issues](https://github.com/go-sprout/sprout/issues) to find something that interests you. Use `labels` to filter issues, especially the [good first issue](https://github.com/go-sprout/sprout/labels/good%20first%20issue) label if you're looking for an easier start.

We encourage you to pick an issue and open a pull request with your solution.

### Making Changes

#### Making Changes Using Codespaces

For details on using Codespaces to work on projects, refer to the [GitHub Codespaces documentation](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md).

#### Making Changes Locally

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. [Install the Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
4. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
5. Open your fork in VSCode and initiate the devcontainer with the function `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`.

> Note: Initialization might take a few minutes as the devcontainer sets up your environment.

6. Create a branch and start your changes!

For comprehensive guidance on using devcontainers, refer to [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

### Committing Your Updates

Commit your updates after you're satisfied with the changes. Follow the [Conventional Commits guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for structuring effective commit messages. A linter is available to help maintain consistent commit quality.

Before submitting, review your changes to expedite the review process.

### Pull Request

Once you complete your changes, open a pull request (PR):

- Use the PR template to provide context about your changes and why they are needed.
- [Link your PR to the related issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- Allow [maintainer edits on your PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

After submitting, our team will review your contributions and possibly request further changes. Apply feedback directly through GitHub's UI or make adjustments in your branch as necessary.
